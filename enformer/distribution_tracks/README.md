The folder projects/enformer/distribution_tracks contains scripts to analyse the distribution of the target and predicted tracks.

/calculate_correlation_enformer_tracks_remade: calculate the correlation between the three enformer tracks that I made tfr files for in my first new-tracks-set (22 tracks).
/dnn_newtracks_plot_tracks: plot the target and the output for the new-tracks-model trained on 27/3. 
/heatmap_correlation: plot heatmaps for the correlation between different outputs and targets. Make a boxplot for the correlation of each of the 19 new tracks against all Enformer tracks.
